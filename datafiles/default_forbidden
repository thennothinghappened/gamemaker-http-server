-- Info --
 This file contains a list of all files which are forbidden on the web server. If any client attempts to access these,
 they will receive a 403 forbidden HTTP code. Each line should contain an absolute path, where / is the root directory of the server.

 Any line that does not start with '/' in this file is ignored.

-- Default list --
/forbidden
/config.json
/http_server.win
/http_server.yydebug
/options.ini
/README!!.txt
/default_config.json
/default_forbidden

Unless you plan to allow the user more access, I don't recommend changing these.
Put any new items in the below list.
