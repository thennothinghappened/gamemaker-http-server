Welcome to thennothing's GML HTTP server!
thennothinghappened ( 2022 )

    This server will listen on port 8080 by
    default unless specified in the configuration file.
    A default copy of this file is included in the project.
    Rename that file to 'config.json' and move it to
    the root directory of the web server.

    This server also includes the ability to restrict
    access to any file path. Copy 'default_forbidden' from this folder
    into the root directory of the server and rename, and add or remove
    any files as needed.

    I cannot attest that this server is 100% secure so don't use on a
    machine with sensitive data. Do not use this server for serious 
    uses as there are better alternatives.
    This server exists as a fun side project, so do not expect continuous support!

    If you run into any GML errors with the server or see unexpected
    behaviour, create a bug report on the github page.
    If you choose to compile this server yourself, make sure you
    do not under ***ANY*** circumstances disable file-system sandboxing!!!
    Disabling this option allows any person to access files outside the
    web server's root folder!
