# gamemaker-http-server
 A HTTP 1.1 server written in GML, because why not.

This server uses `%localappdata%\http-server` as the root directory. Currently supports GET, and has a bunch of different status codes. Currently the only web server out there I know of that will give you GML errors on a HTTP `500`. Have fun.
